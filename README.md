Project PAM Software
========

PAM stands for Photoresin Additive Manufacturing. This type of 3D printing gets away from the extruded plastic spaghetti machines that we're all familiar with and instead uses light-curing resins to build your models. 

Project PAM is seeking to take DLP 3D printing in a new direction of higher build volumes and lower costs without sacrificing resolution. The goal for this project is to produce a high resolution DLP printer that is fully open sourced using off-the-shelf hardware and that is well documented. All design material can be found in either the [Hardware Repo][hw] or the Software Repo[sw].

If you would like to donate to Project PAM visit our Indiegogo campaign. Any and all donations would be greatly appreciated.

There have been many attempts at an open source DLP 3D printer, yet many of those attempts have patents associated to the design, non-commercial licensing, or do not properly host and share their designs. Our first priority when starting out was to keep everything open-source; this includes both hardware and software. To ensure this, we have followed the [Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition][OSHWD] set by the Open Source Hardware Association ([OSHA][OSHA]).
